    <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
    <p>
      Our team, <%= @team.name %>, would like to organize a food drive in the near future! We hope to raise <%= @team.goal %> lbs of food for our hungry neighbors in NYC.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'd love to work with you to schedule a pickup time. Three possible dates are <%= @dates[0][:month] %>/<%= @dates[0][:day] %>/<%= @dates[0][:year] %>, <%= @dates[1][:month] %>/<%= @dates[1][:day] %>/<%= @dates[1][:year] %>, and <%= @dates[2][:month] %>/<%= @dates[2][:day] %>/<%= @dates[2][:year] %>. Please feel free to contact me by email or by phone at <%= @phone_number %>. Thank you so much!
    </p>
    <p>
      All the best,
    </p>
